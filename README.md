# czi

A simple GUI tool to view and export czi (Carl Zeiss image) file format with multiple z-levels.

[CZI](https://www.zeiss.com/microscopy/en/products/software/zeiss-zen/czi-image-file-format.html) files are image formats from Carl Zeiss microscopes, [ZEN](https://www.zeiss.com/microscopy/en/products/software/zeiss-zen.html) imaging software saves multidimensional images such as time lapse, Z-stacks, multiposition experiments and virtual slides in this format.

This tool is written with Python and tkinter for graphical user interface. The software is partly based on Zeiss' [libczi](https://zeiss.github.io/libczi/) library, the [czifile](https://pypi.org/project/czifile) python package, and [tkinter-range-slider](https://github.com/lgimberis/tkinter-range-slider).
