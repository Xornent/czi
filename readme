1)  introduction
----------------

    a simple gui tool to view and export czi (carl zeiss image) file format with 
    multiple z-levels.

    czi (https://www.zeiss.com/microscopy/en/products/software/zeiss-zen/
    czi-image-file-format.html) files are image formats from Carl Zeiss microscopes, 
    ZEN (https://www.zeiss.com/microscopy/en/products/software/zeiss-zen.html) 
    imaging  software saves multidimensional images such as time lapse, z-stacks, 
    multiposition experiments and virtual slides in this format.

    this tool is written with python and tkinter for graphical user interface. the 
    software is partly based on zeiss' libczi (https://zeiss.github.io/libczi/) 
    library, the czifile (https://pypi.org/project/czifile) python package, and 
    tkinter-range-slider (https://github.com/lgimberis/tkinter-range-slider).
